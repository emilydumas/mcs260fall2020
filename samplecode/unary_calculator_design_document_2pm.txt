Unary = every command takes one argument

A calculator simulation that prints a prompt,
waits for commands, and performs calculations.
It will maintain a single float value that
is printed after each command.

Each command has the form
   NAME ARGUMENT

Where NAME is the command name (e.g. "mul",
"add","div","sub",...), and ARGUMENT is a float
literal that is the number to which the command
applies.

Sample session:
0.000
>add 5
5.000
>mul 2
10.000
>div 5
2.000
>
