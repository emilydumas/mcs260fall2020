    "\n",
    "Now, create a file `test_geom.py` in the same folder that contains at least 4 tests for `geom.py` in the format expected by pytest.  That is, each test should be in a function whose name begins with `test_`.  Running this script with the python interpreter should do nothing, since it should only declare test functions, and should not call them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run pytest and confirm that all of your tests are discovered, and that they all pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of suggested tests:\n",
    "* two Circle objects created to have the same center an radius compare as equal\n",
    "* two Rectangle objects created to have the same center, width, and height compare as equal\n",

    "* adding two example rectangles gives the same bounding box as you compute by hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the equality test for objects in `geom.py` is very fragile, because it tests floats for equality.  One way to avoid problems with floating point error is to choose examples where every value involved (width, height, center coordinates, radius, scale factor, etc.) is actually an integer."
