    "This program takes a series of words as command line arguments and peforms certain substitutions on the lower-case alphabet letters in these words.  All other characters are left unchanged.  The resulting words are then printed to the terminal, separated by single spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific substitution pattern is as follows:  Each lower-case alphabet character is shifted forward in the alphabet by 13 positions.  Thus 'a' (index 0) becomes 'n' (index 13).  If shifting forward moves past the end of the alphabet, we wrap around and return to the beginning.  Equivalently we increase the index by 13 but then take the remainder when diving by 26.  So, for example, 's' (letter 18) becomes 'f' (letter 5) because 18+13 == 31 and 31 % 26 == 5.  Because of the wrap-around behavior of this process, we say the letter is *rotated* by 13 positions.\n",
